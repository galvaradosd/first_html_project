<h1>The Best Movies According to MÃ¡ncho</h1>

<h2>My Top 5 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>No. 5: Taken</h3>
<p>This is the first action movie that shows the main character to go at great length to rescue or save his loved ones.</p>

<h3>No. 4: Edge of tomorrow</h3>
<p>This is the best movie about action time travel plot, it's a masterful piece of science fiction.</p>

<h3>No. 3: Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>The firs of the best two action super hero movies of all time.</p>

<h3>No. 2: Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>The best conclusion for the Avengers saga.</p>

<h3>No. 1: John Wick</h3>
<p>The most accurate in my feelings about what would happen if something happens to my dogs, a main character on a revenge quest for his dog.</p>
